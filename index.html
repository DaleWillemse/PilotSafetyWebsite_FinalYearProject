            When we examine safety gaps in single-propeller airplanes, we're essentially looking at weak spots or vulnerabilities that may lead to accidents that could have been prevented. It's important to identify and address these gaps to ensure that flying in single-propeller planes remains as safe as possible.

In terms of fatalities, 'collision events' stood out as the most significant consequence, while 'engine-related events' were the most frequent events, and 'inadequate maintenance procedures' emerged as the most concerning maintenance factor.

      <h1>Things to Consider</h1>
      Beyond doing pre- and post-flight inspections and fixing safety gaps, there are other important things to take into account when it comes to aviation safety. These factors take a more comprehensive approach to preserving and improving aviation safety. Here are a few important points to remember:
      <div class="infoBox">
      <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showWeather()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgWeather" src="images/arrow.png">Weather Conditions</button>
      <div id="infoWeather">
      When planning a flight, it is important to consider both the present and anticipated weather. Recognize the possible weather-related risks that might affect your trip's safety, including thunderstorms, and turbulence.
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showEmergency()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgEmergency" src="images/arrow.png">Emergency Procedures</button>
        <div id="infoEmergency">
          Learn how to use the emergency equipment and procedures on the aircraft. Being prepared for emergencies and knowing what to do can save lives. This involves going through evacuation protocols, fire drills, and emergency landings.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showFitness()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgFitness" src="images/arrow.png">Medical Fitness</button>
        <div id="infoFitness"> 
          Members of the crew and pilots need to stay in good physical and mental health. To guarantee that you are fit to safely fly an aircraft, routine medical examinations are necessary.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showCompliance()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgCompliance" src="images/arrow.png">Regulatory Compliance</button>
        <div id="infoCompliance">
          Keep up of aviation legislation and make sure your activities abide by national and international legal requirements. Make sure your activities are compliant by periodically reviewing the most recent modifications to aviation rules.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    These factors are just as important for guaranteeing aviation safety as the standard pre- and post-flight inspections. However, they go beyond these. You may contribute to the creation of a more dependable and safe aviation environment for all parties involved by implementing these elements into your operating procedures.
