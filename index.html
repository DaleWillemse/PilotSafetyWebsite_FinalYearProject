          <h1>Safety Gaps</h1>
          <p>
            When we examine safety gaps in single-propeller airplanes, we're essentially looking at weak spots or vulnerabilities that may lead to accidents that could have been prevented. It's important to identify and address these gaps to ensure that flying in single-propeller planes remains as safe as possible.
          <br>
          <div class="infoBox">
          <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showAircraftMaintenance()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgMaintenance" src="images/arrow.png">Aircraft Maintenance</button>
          <div id="AircraftMaintenance">
          <p>
            In a study done by Insley and Turkoglu, they found that Maintenance-related problems were a contributing factor in several accidents in aircraft. These issues tended to be linked to failures in the engine and landing gear systems. Key maintenance issues uncovered were 'inadequate maintenance procedures' and 'inspections not identifying defects.' When it came to fatalities, 'collision events' stood out as the most significant consequence, while 'engine-related events' were the most frequent events, and 'inadequate maintenance procedures' emerged as the most concerning maintenance factor.
            The research by Insley and Turkoglu provides valuable information into the safety gaps in the maintenance of aircraft. It shows the significance of maintenance-related issues, especially regarding engine and landing gear systems. These issues can be fixed by implementing strict maintenance procedures, improving inspections of the aircraft, and focusing on engine maintenance to decrease the number of accidents caused by maintenance-related issues.

          <div id="fatigueFailure">
          <p>
            Fatigue failure occurs as stress is experienced during normal flight operations this can cause cracks which can grow and cause the structure to fail causing accidents. In a study done by Pollock, Murray, and Wild in which they were researching trends in aircraft fatigue failure they discovered that smaller airplanes were more likely to suffer from Fatigue failure. This finding further strengths the point of needing measures and safety protocols in the maintenance of smaller aircraft so risks that are associated with fatigue-related accidents can be reduced.

          <div id="HumanError">
          <p>
            In a study done by Kelly and Efthymiou, they found the significance of the role human factors play in aviation safety. These findings show the need to address human factors such as decision-making, errors made because of a lack of skill/experience and communication-based issues. Human factors play a crucial role in the safety of single-propeller aircraft operations. By understanding and mitigating the impact of human factors such that it reduces the risk of accidents. This could include providing training programs to improve decision-making skills or addressing skill-based issues. By acknowledging and addressing human errors significant improvements can be made to close this safety gap in single-propeller aircraft.

      <h1>Things to Consider</h1>
      Beyond doing pre- and post-flight inspections and fixing safety gaps, there are other important things to take into account when it comes to aviation safety. These factors take a more comprehensive approach to preserving and improving aviation safety. Here are a few important points to remember:
      <div class="infoBox">
      <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showWeather()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgWeather" src="images/arrow.png">Weather Conditions</button>
      <div id="infoWeather">
      When planning a flight, it is important to consider both the present and anticipated weather. Recognize the possible weather-related risks that might affect your trip's safety, including thunderstorms, and turbulence.
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showEmergency()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgEmergency" src="images/arrow.png">Emergency Procedures</button>
        <div id="infoEmergency">
          Learn how to use the emergency equipment and procedures on the aircraft. Being prepared for emergencies and knowing what to do can save lives. This involves going through evacuation protocols, fire drills, and emergency landings.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showFitness()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgFitness" src="images/arrow.png">Medical Fitness</button>
        <div id="infoFitness"> 
          Members of the crew and pilots need to stay in good physical and mental health. To guarantee that you are fit to safely fly an aircraft, routine medical examinations are necessary.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button class="infoBtn" onclick="showCompliance()"><img class="arrowImg" id="arrowImgCompliance" src="images/arrow.png">Regulatory Compliance</button>
        <div id="infoCompliance">
          Keep up of aviation legislation and make sure your activities abide by national and international legal requirements. Make sure your activities are compliant by periodically reviewing the most recent modifications to aviation rules.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    These factors are just as important for guaranteeing aviation safety as the standard pre- and post-flight inspections. However, they go beyond these. You may contribute to the creation of a more dependable and safe aviation environment for all parties involved by implementing these elements into your operating procedures.
